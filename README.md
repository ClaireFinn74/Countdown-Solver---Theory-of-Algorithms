# Countdown-Solver---Theory-of-Algorithms

## Description
1. Project undertaken during my *BSC (Hons) in Computing in Software Development* degree at GMIT for a **Theory of Algorithms** class.
2. The language used is **Scheme/Racket.**
3. An attempt to **solve Countdown**, the game show we all grew up hearing about.

## Rules:
* A set of numbers are displayed:
* The numbers from **1-10 twice,** (for example 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3 etc up to 10) **25, 50, 75 and 100.**
* The user will then be presented with a **random number within the range 101-999.** Let's say for example the number turned out to be 436.
* The user will then have to use the above numbers **(1, 1, 2, 2, 3,3, 4, 4, 5,5, 6, 6, 7. 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100)** to add up to the random number, in this case 436.
* The number, in the everyday gameshow we know of doesn't have to exactly match the random number (436), it can be as close to it, above or below, as possible.
* In this case though, **an error message will be displayed** if its *impossible* to exactly add up to the random number, therefore making it easier to solve Countdown.
