; I will start by defining my lists for countdown:
; My Random list of numbers and my Target Number between the numbers 100-199 inclusive.
;The name of my Random list is RandomList.
; 6 of those numbers inside the list will be used to sum to a Target Number using the basic operands +. -, *, /


;I have added randomisation of numbers within the list using the random function.
;However, I can only get one number generated from the list at a time so I may need to copy this function 5 more times to get the remaining numbers.
;list-ref allows me to reference the list at a given index.
;I have used (random 24) as my list has 24 numbers in it and I want to generate a random number using all 24 charactrs.
;If I wanted to use less numbers in the list and randomise them I would reduce this number.

(define RandomList (list-ref(list 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 8 9 9 10 10 25 50 75 100) (random 24)))
RandomList


;This will be my Target number between 101 and 999 generated randomly
(define TargetNumber (random 101 999))
;Calling my TargetNumber and naming it with a comment
